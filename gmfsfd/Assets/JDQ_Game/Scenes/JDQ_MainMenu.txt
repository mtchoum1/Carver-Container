Instructions: You move a blue square around using the arrow keys. You dodge anything red. 
Some obstacles are moving, and you have to time your movement to avoid them.
If you touch anything red, you get stunned and can't move for 1 second.
Your goal is to get to the blue arrow in the top left of the screen before 30 seconds are up.
You have a timer in the top right to help you keep track of your time remaining.
